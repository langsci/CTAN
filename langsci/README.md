- series.def: metadata for series
- colors.def: colors used by the series
- langsci-basic.sty for commands required by the standard template
- bib style definitions
- modified font files in *ttf, which include a wider coverage of phonetic symbols than the standard fonts
- eps files for the logos used in the textbook series Textbooks in Language Sciences
- logo files in pdf
- the final advertisement file in tikz

The following optional packages are also provided, but have to be included manually if desired:
- langsci-optional.sty: additional useful commands
- langsci-gb4e.sty and langsci-cgloss.sty typeset linguistic examples
- langsci-forest-setup.sty: definitions for linguistic trees
- langsci-bidi.sty: bidirectional text
